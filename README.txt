This is a client for the Groupon (www.groupon.com) service. It utilizes the groupon API to get all data feeds and links back to the Groupon mobile website for purchases. 

This project was done mainly as an experiment to learn about WebOS mobile programming. The Groupon mobile site at http://touch.groupon.com/ is just as (if not more) functional than this application is.
